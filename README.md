# Stanimalis Thrift Shop

This web app will eventually be split between ASP.NET Core via Web API and React or Angular.  It will enable users to shop for my baseball thrift goods such as jerseys, caps, and collectibles (e.g. autographed baseballs and bobbleheads from Mets games).  There are categories, fake payments, products, orders, and a searchbar.  I will also allow for reviews on products as well as use a sentiment analysis API to not let users send negative messages to the admin although I realize that sometimes negative reviews warrant such sentiment.
